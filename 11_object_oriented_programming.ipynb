    "Why are there two classes which both describe a course? This is an example of the way that translation of real-life concepts into objects in your code may not always be as straightforward as it appears. Would it have made sense to have a single course object which has both description, code and department attributes and a list of students?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two distinct concepts, both of which can be called a “course”, that we need to represent: one is the theoretical idea of a course, which is offered by a department every year and always has the same name and code, and the other is the course as it is run in a particular year, each time with a different group of enrolled students. We have represented these two concepts by two separate classes which are linked to each other. Course is the theoretical description of a course, and CourseRunning is the concrete instance of a course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have defined several relationships between these classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A student can be enrolled in several courses (CourseRunning objects), and a course (CourseRunning) can have multiple students enrolled in it in a particular year, so this is a many-to-many relationship. A student knows about all his or her courses, and a course has a record of all enrolled students, so this is a bidirectional relationship. These objects aren’t very strongly coupled – a student can exist independently of a course, and a course can exist independently of a student.\n",
    "- A department offers multiple courses (Course objects), but in our implementation a course can only have a single department – this is a one-to-many relationship. It is also bidirectional. Furthermore, these objects are more strongly coupled – you can say that a department owns a course. The course cannot exist without the department.\n",
    "- A similar relationship exists between a course and its “runnings”: it is also bidirectional, one-to-many and strongly coupled it wouldn’t make sense for “MAM1000W run in 2013” to exist on its own in the absence of “MAM1000W”.\n",
    "\n",
    "What words like “exist” and “owns” actually mean for our code can vary. An object which “owns” another object could be responsible for creating that object when it requires it and destroying it when it is no longer needed – but these words can also be used to describe a logical relationship between concepts which is not necessarily literally implemented in that way in the code."
